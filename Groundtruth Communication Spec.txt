Groundtruth Arduino COMMUNICATION SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT

Communication happens to the Groundtruth Arduino using I2C.

The host application initializes the Groundtruth Arduino at address 64. Registers are used to communicate with the various functions of the Groundtruth sensor.

Register            Address		Data Sent
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Groundtruth data    01			1 byte (1 or 2)
Main Lights         02			3 bytes (R G B)
Frontside Lights    03			1 byte (0, 1, or 2 -> Front, Back, Off)
Gear Lights         04			3 bytes (Mode, Left intensity, Right intensity)
Shooter Lights      05			1 byte (0, 1, 2 -> Off, Aiming, Aim Lock)
Intake Lights       06			1 byte (0 or 1 -> Intake ON or OFF)
PULSE speed         11			1 byte (Speed value)

Groundtruth X-Y and IMAGE data
Address: 01
Data: 1 byte - 1 or 2
	1:
		returns 6 bytes: LEFT_X, LEFT_Y, LEFT_SQUAL, RIGHT_X, RIGHT_Y, RIGHT_SQUAL
	2:
		returns 648 bytes, representing the LEFT and RIGHT sensor images in order. The first 324 bytes are the LEFT sensor image, the next 324 bytes are the RIGHT sensor image.

Main Lights
Address: 02
Data: 3 bytes, representing the R G and B bytes of the color to be displayed.

Frontside Lights
Address: 03
Data: 1 byte - 0 for default frontside, 1 for reverse lights, and 2 for both lights off

Gear Lights
Address: 04
Data: 3 bytes - First byte is MODE (0 for OFF, 1 for PULSE, 2 for INDIVIDUAL INTENSITY). In PULSE mode, both lights pulse on and off and any other input is ignored. In INDIVIDUAL INTENSITY mode, the next two bytes control the intensity level of the LEFT and RIGHT gearholder lights, respectively.

Shooter Lights
Address: 05
Data: 1 byte - 0 for shooter OFF, 1 for AIMING, and 2 for AIM LOCK.
	NOTE: While AIMING, the lights will pulse ON and OFF automatically.

Intake Lights
Address: 06
Data: 1 byte - 0 for intake OFF, 1 for intake ON

PULSE speed
Address: 11
Data: 1 byte - A number, 1 - 255, that controls how fast the pulsing happens. Higher is faster. Based on adding the pulse number to the current pulse byte at a 10ms update rate - so a pulse rate of 1 pulses OFF to ON in 2550ms.
